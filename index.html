                This API provides flood prediction based on location-specific weather data. 
                It uses machine learning models to process both historical and forecasted data.

                <h3> Features of the API</h3>
                <div class="text">
                <p> It uses advanced data analysis and <strong>neural networks</strong> to provide very accurate flood risk predictions.
                    By seamlessly integrating real-time weather forecasts with historical data for the past <strong>23 days</strong> ,
                    the API thereby ensures that its predictions are on time and informed by current trends. This multi-layered strategy 
                    encompasses a comprehensive flood-risk analysis while taking into account <strong> rainfall, temperature variability, humidity,
                    and wind patterns. Moreover, the API predicts up to 7 days</strong> in advance about weather conditions, which often makes
                    the crucial difference between preparation and precipitation.
                </p>
    
                <p>    Trained on diverse and region-specific Indian meteorological datasets,
                    this model presently achieves an accuracy rate of almost 97%. This high precision makes it a reliable source
                     for solving the unique weather challenges that are prevalent in India, especially in flood-prone areas. The API is 
                     developer-friendly and can be used in different applications, such as weather monitoring platforms and disaster management 
                     systems.

                <h3> Parameters Explained</h3>
                <ul class="text">
                    <p>The API provides a detailed set of parameters for accurate flood prediction-</p>

                  <p><strong>Cloud Coverage:</strong>  The average percentage of the sky covered by clouds. Higher values indicate overcast conditions.</p> 
                  <p><strong> Humidity:</strong> The average atmospheric moisture level, expressed as a percentage.</p> 
                  <p><strong>Maximum & Minimum Temperatures:</strong>  The highest and lowest daily temperatures, measured in degrees Celsius.</p>  
                  <p> <strong>Wind Speed:</strong>  The average wind speed in meters per second, which can influence weather patterns.</p>
                  <p> <strong>Sunshine Duration:</strong>  Sum total of hours in a day the place gets sunshine, influencing evaporation and conditions.</p>
                  <p> <strong>Rainfall Sum</strong> : Accumulated millimeter sum of rainfall during the analyzed period.</p>
                   <strong>Flood Probability:</strong> 
                   Through this integration, the API returns all weather and flood-prone insights.
                
                <p>
                    All the data is retrieved from a public weather forecast API available at <a href="https://open-meteo.com/">Open-Meteo</a> .By combining these parameters, the API delivers comprehensive insights into weather 
                    patterns and flood risks.

            <ul class="text">
            <p>
                Despite its accuracy, the Flood Prediction API has some limitations-
            </p>
            
                
                   <p> <strong>Hosting Delay:</strong> Since the API is hosted on Render, the first call may take 
                    up to 50 seconds to fetch data due to server spin-up times.</p>
                
               
                    <p> <strong>Surface Elevation:</strong> The API does not consider ground elevation. For example, areas 
                    below sea level are more prone to flooding but cannot be evaluated due to data limitations.</p>
                
                
                    <p>  <strong>Data Gaps:</strong> The training dataset lacks specific scenarios, such as ground-level flooding, 
                    making it challenging to predict certain cases.</p>
                
           
            <p>
                These are the limitations of the model and areas for improvement and potential integration with more comprehensive datasets in the future.

            <h3 id="useapi"> How to Use the API</h3>
            
        <ol class="text">
            <p>Follow these steps to integrate the API into your application:</p>
                Copy the API endpoint using the "Copy URL" button.</li>
                Make an HTTP GET request with latitude and longitude parameters in the query string.</li>
                Parse the JSON response, which includes all relevant weather data and flood probabilities.</li>
            
            <p>
                Example response from the API-
            </p>
        </ol>
            <pre>
{
    "avg_cloud_coverage": 65,
    "avg_humidity": 80,
    "avg_max_temp": 34,
    "avg_min_temp": 26,
    "avg_wind_speed": 5.6,
    "latitude": 20.5,
    "longitude": 78.96,
    "sunshine_duration": 8,
    "total_rain_sum": 12.5,
    "flood_probability": 0.45
}
            </pre>
            <p>
                The <strong>flood_probability</strong> parameter ranges from 0 (no flood risk) to 100 
                (extremely high flood risk). Use this value to make informed decisions.
